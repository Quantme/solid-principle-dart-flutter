Liskov Substitution Principle
=============================

The **Liskov substitution principle** (LSP) is a particular definition of subtyping relation, called _strong behavioral subtyping_, that was initially introduced by **Barbara Liskov** in a 1998 conference keynote address titled **Data abstraction and hierarchy**. It is based on the concept of "substitutability" _â€”a principle in object-oriented programming stating that an object (such a class) and a sub-object (such a class that extends the first class) must be interchangeable without breaking the program_.

**Liskov Substitution Principle** (LSP) states that ***objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application***. In other words, what we want is to have the objects of our subclasses behaving the same way as the objects of our suplerclass.
