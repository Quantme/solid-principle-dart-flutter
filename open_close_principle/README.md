Open-Close Principle
====================

Robert C. Martin considered this principle as _the most important principle of object-oriented design_. But he wasn't the first one who defined it.

Bertrand Meyer wrote about it in 1998 in his book _Object-Oriented Software Construction_. He explained the Open/Close Principle as: ***Software entities(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open por extension, but closed for modification.***
